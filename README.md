# Canadas-Population-Analysis

The project aimed to comprehensively analyze population trends across Canada’s provinces from 2014 to 2024, enabling insights into growth patterns, demographic shifts, and their broader implications on urban planning, healthcare, education, and economic development. The work involved the following stages and methodologies:

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**:  
   We started by gathering population data across various Canadian regions, focusing on quality and reliability to ensure accurate analysis. This involved meticulous data cleaning to address errors, discrepancies, and missing values, which was critical to maintaining data integrity and producing reliable insights.

2. **Descriptive Statistical Analysis**:  
   To summarize the data, we applied descriptive statistical techniques, calculating measures such as mean, median, standard deviation, and variance. This provided a clear understanding of the data’s distribution and variability, allowing us to identify key characteristics, such as Ontario and Quebec’s high population counts.

3. **Data Visualization**:  
   We created visualizations, such as bar charts and histograms, to present the data in an accessible, intuitive format. Through graphs and maps, we illustrated population distribution and growth patterns, identifying Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, Alberta, and British Columbia as the most populous regions. These visualizations helped uncover the provinces’ attractiveness due to economic and lifestyle factors.

4. **Linear Regression Analysis**:  
   Linear regression was applied to model the relationship between population as the dependent variable and independent variables like time and geography. We derived coefficients representing these variables, helping to predict population changes over time. With an R-squared value of 0.9685, our model achieved a strong fit, indicating that 96.85% of the population variability could be explained by these factors.

5. **Time Series Analysis and Forecasting**:  
   We conducted time series analysis to identify patterns and trends over the years, allowing you to forecast future population changes. This analysis revealed a positive growth trend in population over the decade. Seasonal trends, such as quarterly peaks in population figures, suggested factors like tourism, migration, and temporary employment cycles.

6. **Statistical Inference via ANOVA**:  
   To examine whether population changes were statistically significant across different years, we conducted an ANOVA test. The test results indicated no significant yearly differences in population, suggesting stable growth rather than major fluctuations. This finding supported the presence of consistent, steady growth patterns.

7. **Error Analysis and Model Evaluation**:  
   We evaluated our model’s accuracy through Mean Squared Error (MSE), with a high MSE value indicating potential areas for improvement. This assessment highlighted opportunities to refine predictive models and reduce discrepancies between actual and predicted population values.

8. **Conclusion and Policy Recommendations**:  
   Finally, we summarized key findings and provided recommendations for policymakers and urban planners. Emphasizing the need for resource allocation in infrastructure, healthcare, and education, we suggested that insights from the population data could inform long-term, sustainable development strategies. By anticipating demographic shifts, stakeholders could proactively address the demands of Canada’s growing population.

# Outcomes:
The project revealed steady population growth across Canada’s most populous provinces—Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, Alberta, and British Columbia—primarily driven by migration and natural increase. Seasonal trends indicated temporary population spikes, likely tied to tourism and employment. A strong correlation between population changes, time, and region enabled accurate forecasting, while ANOVA results confirmed consistent growth across years, supporting reliable planning. These findings underscore the need for strategic resource allocation and sustainable development in key areas like infrastructure and healthcare to meet the demands of a growing population. Future refinements could further enhance predictive accuracy by including additional variables.
